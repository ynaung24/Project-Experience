## About Me

My name is Yan Naing Aung. Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! I am an applied economist working as an AI Engineer at Minty Living while pursuing my MS Data Science degree from University of San Francisco. The area of study I am focusing on are Large Language Models (LLMs), machine learning algorithms, causal inference, experimentations, and predictive analytics. I have completed multiple data science projects leveraging SQL and Python to draw causal effects utilizing real-world data while providing actionable insights for businesses.

On a more personal note, I'm an average golfer currently trying to break 80 and getting into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ).
